            <h1>About The Club</h1>
            <p class="text-left"><img src="img/about2.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right img-thumbnail">The Copper Harbor Trails Society Inc. also known as Copper Harbor Trails Club (CHTC) is officially a 501C-3 non-profit with a mission to advocate, develop and maintain trails and land for human-powered activities in and connecting to Copper Harbor. What we really are is a bunch of fun people that want to share the joy of mountain biking and other trail based human-powered recreation with all ages. We build sustainable, purpose built trails in and connecting to the tiny, 100 resident town of Copper Harbor.  In addition, we partner with organizations that have similar goals and work with them to improve trail access throughout the region. During the other six months of the year (some may call it winter), with the help of volunteer groomers, we maintain a few kilometers of ski trail stretching between the town of Copper Harbor and Fort Wilkins Historic State Park, plus our volunteers groom the Churning Rapids Snow Bike Trails outside Hancock.  The Copper Harbor Trails Club also built and helps maintain a 9 hole disc golf course on the grounds of the Keweenaw Mountain Lodge.  Basically we love trails and we do what we can to continually improve the system and host events that showcase the trails and support the local economy.   </p> <br />
